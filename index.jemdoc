== Projects
- Funded by Topsec (Tianrongxin), I am jointly conducting the research project *“Design of Security Testing Framework and Risk Assessment for Large Language Models”*.  
  This project focuses on the safety and risk management of LLMs in real-world applications, aiming to develop systematic testing methodologies and evaluation frameworks.
